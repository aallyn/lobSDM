BD: Initiated the repository. 
    Imported data from ME/NH, MA, NEFSC, and DFO
    Subset to juvenile lobster (<82 mm carapace length)
    Subset to potential lobster predators (from [fish habits database](https://fwdp.shinyapps.io/tm2020/)
    Subset to predators >= 20 cm
        NOTE: Should we consider basing this threshold on Barnes et al. 2010? Or similar metanalyses of predator:prey body size ratios?

BD: Worked on correcting errors in the individual files. Including summarizing weights before aggregating, units issues, etc.
